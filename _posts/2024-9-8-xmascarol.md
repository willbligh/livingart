A one-man show retelling Charles Dickens’ classic tale of redemption and compassion. The story of Ebenezer Scrooge who on a cold Christmas Eve night is taken on a terrifying journey by three ghosts and shown the error of his ways, offers a timeless message about greed and the joy of sharing.

Will Bligh stars in this unique adaptation recreating Scrooges’s world using lighting, sound and a wooden chair. Experience a dynamic and visceral performance as all of your favourite characters, including Bob Cratchit, Jacob Marley, Tiny Tim and the three ghosts, are brought to life on stage. 

This adaptation of A Christmas Carol develops a performance which moves away from a recital of the Dickens’ text to a more dramatic and engaging performance. This has been achieved by completely removing the narrator from the script, which allows the characters to develop each situation to maximise the drama on-stage. A second aim was to create a one-man show that opens up the theatrical possibilities for the performance. The removal of props and costumes frees the performer to engage with the audience in an energetic and visceral manner. There is also a tendency to portray Scrooge a caricature, and not as a ‘real’ person. I believe the contradictions is what makes Scrooge a compelling experience and allows the transformation he undergoes on stage to be an enlightening and relevant story for the audience.
