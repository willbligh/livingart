### Mission Statement
<div style="text-align: justify;">
The Breaking Stereotypes of the Elderly (BSE) project is dedicated to challenging and breaking the stereotypes surrounding elderly Australians over the age of sixty-five by telling authentic, diverse, and empowering stories that celebrate the richness of their lives. This project will allow older people to represent themselves, rather than being portrayed by other age groups which may represent cultural biases. The aim is to shift the narrative from one of limitation to one of vibrancy, resilience, and continued growth. Through compelling storytelling, a short film will portray elderly individuals not as marginalised or forgotten members of society, but as dynamic, multifaceted people who continue to inspire, contribute, and lead in ways that defy conventional expectations. Our mission is to create a powerful, positive representation that fosters respect, empathy, and a deeper understanding of the value that older generations bring to our world.
