"Now I am alone.." As seen through Hamlet's eyes and created entirely from Shakespeare's text, experi- ence a unique interpretation which has entertained audiences in New York, Berlin, Prague and Sydney.

This performance is a solo rendition using only Shakespeare's text to present the play as seen through Hamlet's eyes, creating an immediate and personal ex- perience of the play.

Hamlet is uniquely suited to the format of a one-man show as the play's dramatic tension stems from Hamlet's internal thought processes rather than a conflict between two charac- ters. His sense of isolation and alienation are emphasised by removing other actors from the stage.
